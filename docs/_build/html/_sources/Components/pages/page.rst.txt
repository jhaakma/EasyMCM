A ``Page`` is a container that holds other components. It acts a bit like a 
page on your web browser, in that you have tabs across the top of 
your menu to selecta page to view. Pages must go in the 
``pages`` table in your template.

The default page is a simple container, it is recommended you use 
the `SideBarPage`_ for basic settings.::

    --Page fields
    {
        label = "Page 1",
        class = "Page",
        components = {},
    }

label
    The ``label`` field is displayed in the tab for that page at the top 
    of the menu.

class (Optional)
    Can be set to custom page types. Defaults to "Page" for all entries in 
    the ``pages`` table in the template.

components
    A list of components to display.
