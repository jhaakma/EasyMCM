Setting
=============

A setting is a component that the player interacts with 
in some way. Interacting with a setting may update a 
`Variable`_, or it may call a custom function. 

The Setting class does nothing on it's own, but acts 
as the base class or other settings.

.. _`Variable`: ../../../variables/Variable.html
