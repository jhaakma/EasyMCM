EasyMCM is a UI library for MWSE's Mod Config Menu, for the game Morrowind. 

Uses a custom build class framework for maximum flexibility and extendibility. 

This library allows you to create complex, flexible MCM menus for your mod without having to touch any UI code. Simply create a table that defines the structure and variables of your config settings and the rest is done for you. 

Comes with a number of setting types including buttons, sliders and dropdowns, and you can group settings into pages and categories.

All components, from pages to categories to settings, can be completely and easily modified from within your mcm data file, in order to create your own implementation. Simply override any method or field for that class by defining it in the mcmData table for that component.
